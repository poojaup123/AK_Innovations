# HR Notification Integration Guide

## How HR Notifications Work

When you process salary for Employee X, Recipient Y will automatically receive notifications if:

1. ✅ **Y is added as HR recipient** (with HR Events enabled)
2. ✅ **Notification code is integrated** into salary processing  
3. ✅ **API keys are configured** (SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS)

## Current Status

- ✅ HR notification system is ready
- ✅ Database schema includes all HR fields
- ✅ Test recipient added successfully
- ❌ API keys need configuration for actual delivery
- ❌ Integration needed in salary processing routes

## Step-by-Step Integration

### Step 1: Add API Keys (Required for actual notifications)

Go to your Replit Secrets and add:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - for email notifications
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - for SMS notifications  
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - for SMS notifications
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` - your Twilio phone number

### Step 2: Integrate into Salary Processing

Add this code to your salary processing route:

```python
from services.hr_notifications import send_hr_notification
from datetime import datetime

# In your salary processing route
@employees_bp.route('/salary/process', methods=['POST'])
def process_salary():
    # Your existing salary processing logic here...
    
    if salary_processed_successfully:
        # Send HR notification
        send_hr_notification(
            'salary_payment',
            employee_id=employee.id,
            employee_name=employee.name,
            salary_amount=salary_amount,
            month_year=payment_period,
            payment_date=datetime.now()
        )
    
    # Rest of your route logic...
```

### Step 3: Add HR Recipients

1. Go to `/notifications/admin/recipients/add`
2. Add recipient with:
   - Name: Y's name
   - Email: Y's email
   - Phone: Y's phone (for SMS)
   - Role: HR Manager or HR Executive
   - Enable "HR Events" checkbox
   - Select notification channels (Email, SMS, WhatsApp)

## Test Results

Our test showed:
- ✅ HR recipient "Test HR Manager" found
- ✅ Notification service triggered correctly
- ✅ 2 notification attempts logged (email + SMS)
- ❌ Delivery failed due to missing API keys

## Notification Log Example

```
Salary Payment Processed - Employee X
Employee: Employee X (ID: 123)
Amount: ₹50,000.00
Period: December 2024
Payment Date: 05-08-2025
```

## Next Steps

1. **Configure API keys** in Replit Secrets
2. **Add the integration code** to your employee salary routes
3. **Test with real recipients** 

Once API keys are added, recipient Y will receive:
- ✅ **Email notifications** with detailed salary information
- ✅ **SMS alerts** with summary information
- ✅ **WhatsApp messages** (if enabled)
- ✅ **In-app notifications** within the system

The system is fully functional and ready - just needs API keys and route integration!
