# Production Tracking in Unified Job Work + GRN System

## Overview
The unified Job Work + GRN system provides complete production tracking through different workflows based on work type (in-house vs outsourced), ensuring full material traceability from raw materials to finished goods.

## Production Tracking Workflows

### 1. IN-HOUSE JOB WORK TRACKING

When materials are sent for **in-house job work**, the system automatically:

#### Material Flow:
```
Raw Materials → WIP (Work in Progress) → Finished Goods
```

#### Automatic Production Updates:
- **When Job Work is Created**: Materials move from `Raw Materials` to `WIP` inventory
- **When GRN is Received**: Completed items move from `WIP` to `Finished Goods`
- **Production Records**: System automatically creates/updates Production records linked to the BOM

#### Key Features:
✓ **Real-time WIP Tracking**: Materials are tracked in Work-in-Progress state during processing
✓ **BOM Integration**: Production costs calculated from BOM (Bill of Materials)
✓ **Quality Control**: Quality checks recorded in GRN (passed/rejected quantities)
✓ **Scrap Tracking**: Automatic scrap calculation and inventory adjustment
✓ **Cost Allocation**: Labor costs and overhead automatically allocated to production

#### Example Flow:
```
1. Send 100 units for "Cutting" process (in-house)
   → 100 units move from Raw Materials to WIP

2. Receive 95 units back via GRN (5 units scrap)
   → 95 units move from WIP to Finished Goods
   → 5 units recorded as scrap
   → Production record updated with actual quantities
```

### 2. OUTSOURCED JOB WORK TRACKING

When materials are sent for **outsourced job work**, the system:

#### Material Flow:
```
Raw Materials → External Processing → Finished Goods + Vendor Payable
```

#### Workflow Management:
- **GRN Creation**: Records materials received from vendor
- **Invoice Workflow**: Tracks vendor invoice receipt and payment
- **Vendor Payables**: Automatically creates accounting entries for vendor payments
- **Cost Tracking**: Captures outsourced processing costs

#### Key Features:
✓ **Vendor Management**: Tracks which vendor processed the materials
✓ **Invoice Integration**: Links vendor invoices to specific job work
✓ **Payment Tracking**: Complete Purchase-to-Payment workflow
✓ **Cost Control**: Compares expected vs actual outsourcing costs

#### Example Flow:
```
1. Send 100 units to Vendor A for "Heat Treatment"
   → 100 units marked as sent to external vendor

2. Receive 98 units back via GRN
   → 98 units added to Finished Goods
   → Vendor payable created for ₹10,000
   → GRN workflow started (awaiting invoice)

3. Receive vendor invoice
   → Invoice matched with GRN
   → Payment prepared for vendor
```

## Integration with Existing Production Module

### BOM-Driven Production Planning
The unified system integrates seamlessly with your existing production planning:

- **Multi-Level BOMs**: Complex assemblies with sub-assemblies tracked through job work
- **Material Requirements**: Automatic calculation of materials needed for job work
- **Process Routing**: Each job work process maps to BOM process steps
- **Cost Rollup**: Outsourced costs automatically included in final product cost

### Real-Time Production Dashboard
Your production dashboard now shows:

- **In-Progress Job Works**: Materials currently in WIP state
- **Completed Job Works**: Recently finished job work contributing to finished goods
- **Quality Metrics**: Pass/fail rates from job work quality checks
- **Cost Analysis**: Actual vs planned costs including outsourced work

### Advanced Tracking Features

#### 1. Batch-Wise Tracking
- Each job work can be linked to specific material batches
- Complete traceability from raw material batch to finished product
- Quality issues can be traced back to specific batches

#### 2. Multi-Process Job Work
```
Raw Material → Process 1 (Cutting) → Process 2 (Welding) → Process 3 (Painting) → Finished Goods
```
- Each process step tracked separately
- Materials can be partially received after each step
- Quality checks at each stage

#### 3. Nested Job Work
- Sub-assemblies can have their own job work processes
- Parent assemblies automatically updated when sub-assembly job work completes
- Complete Bill of Materials hierarchy maintained

## Live Production Monitoring

### Real-Time Status Updates
- **WIP Dashboard**: Shows all materials currently in job work processes
- **Live Status**: Real-time updates when materials are received via GRN
- **Alerts**: Notifications when job work is overdue or quality issues arise

### Production Intelligence
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Cycle times for each process and vendor
- **Quality Trends**: Pass/fail rates over time
- **Cost Analysis**: Variance analysis between planned and actual costs
- **Vendor Performance**: Delivery times and quality metrics for outsourced work

## Complete Material Traceability

### End-to-End Tracking
```
Purchase Order → Raw Materials → Job Work (WIP) → GRN → Finished Goods → Sales
```

Every material movement is tracked:
- Which PO brought the raw material
- Which job work processed it
- Which GRN received it back
- Which sales order consumed the finished product

### Audit Trail
- Complete history of material movements
- Quality decisions and approvals
- Cost allocations and adjustments
- Vendor interactions and payments

## Implementation Benefits

✓ **Unified Interface**: Single system for both in-house and outsourced work
✓ **Automatic Updates**: No manual inventory adjustments needed
✓ **Real-Time Visibility**: Live status of all production activities
✓ **Cost Control**: Accurate cost allocation and variance analysis
✓ **Quality Management**: Built-in quality control at every step
✓ **Vendor Management**: Complete vendor performance tracking
✓ **Compliance**: Full audit trail for regulatory requirements

## Next Steps for Enhanced Production Tracking

1. **Mobile GRN**: Allow shop floor workers to record GRN on mobile devices
2. **Barcode Scanning**: Quick material tracking with barcode/QR codes
3. **IoT Integration**: Real-time machine data for accurate production timing
4. **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast production bottlenecks and quality issues
5. **Advanced Reporting**: Custom production reports and KPI dashboards

This unified system ensures that whether your production happens in-house or through vendors, you have complete visibility and control over every aspect of the manufacturing process.
