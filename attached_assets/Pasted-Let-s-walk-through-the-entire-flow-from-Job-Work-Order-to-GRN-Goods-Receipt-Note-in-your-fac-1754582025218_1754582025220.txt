Let’s walk through the **entire flow from Job Work Order → to GRN (Goods Receipt Note)** in your factory management system, especially for **multi-process, multi-vendor job work**, with proper accounting, inventory, and inspection.

## ✅ OVERVIEW: Job Work to GRN

## 🔧 STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION

### 🔹 1. **Job Work Order Creation**

* **Use case**: You want to get a *Mounted Plate* made.
* This plate needs:

  * Cutting → Vendor A
  * Notching → Vendor B
  * Zinc Plating → Vendor C
* You raise a **Job Work Order (JWO)** in your system.

#### Sample Job Work Order

| Field                | Value                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| JWO No.              | JW-001                            |
| Item                 | Mounted Plate                     |
| Qty                  | 100                               |
| Process Route        | Cutting → Notching → Zinc Plating |
| Vendor (Per Process) | A, B, C                           |
| Expected Delivery    | 7 Days                            |

---

### 🔹 2. **System Creates Sub-Jobs per Process**

System splits the JWO:

```text
JW-001-A: Cutting → Vendor A
JW-001-B: Notching → Vendor B
JW-001-C: Zinc Plating → Vendor C
```

Each sub-job will be tracked independently.

---

### 🔹 3. **Raw Material Issue (Challan)**

* You issue raw material (like MS Sheet) to Vendor A.
* Create **Job Work Challan** for traceability.
* Stock is moved to **Vendor A’s WIP stock location**.

> **Accounting Entry (Optional):**
>
> * No accounting impact at this stage (just stock transfer).

---

### 🔹 4. **Process Execution by Vendor**

* Vendor performs the assigned operation (e.g., Cutting).
* They send the **processed material back**.
* You now need to **acknowledge the return** — this is where GRN starts.

---

### 🔹 5. **Create GRN (Step 1: Receipt of Goods)**

At this stage:

* You open the GRN form and select:

  * Job Work Order: `JW-001-A`
  * Vendor: `Vendor A`
  * Received Qty: `100`
  * Process: `Cutting`
  * Add supporting documents (delivery challan, E-way bill)

System updates:

* **WIP Inventory** with "Cut component"
* Or optionally allows **direct transfer to next vendor**

> ✅ GRN is **mandatory** at each step for traceability.

---

### 🔹 6. **System Generates GRN Voucher**

As per your 3-step GRN system:

#### 🎫 Step 1: GRN Voucher (Cutting stage)

| Ledger                   | Debit/Credit |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Inventory (Cut Parts)    | Dr           |
| GRN Clearing Account     | Cr           |
| GST Input Tax (Optional) | Dr           |

---

### 🔹 7. **Inspection of Received Material**

After GRN:

* **Inspection** linked to this GRN
* Mark each line item as:

  * ✅ Accepted
  * ❌ Rejected
  * 🔁 Sent for Rework

System records:

* Inventory updates
* Rejected material tracking
* Future reprocessing (if rework needed)

---

### 🔹 8. **Repeat for Each Stage**

Vendor B performs Notching → returns material → Create GRN for JW-001-B
Vendor C performs Zinc Plating → returns material → Final GRN for JW-001-C

Each GRN is recorded, inspected, and linked to its process stage.

---

### 🔹 9. **Final Assembly Completion**

Once all stages are complete:

* Mounted Plate is marked as **"Ready"**
* Final cost is calculated (material + vendor charges)
* System updates **FG Inventory**

---

## 🧮 Accounting Summary (Per GRN)

For each stage:

| Action           | Ledger Entries                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| GRN Created      | Dr: Inventory, Dr: GST, Cr: GRN Clearing |
| Invoice Received | Dr: GRN Clearing, Cr: Vendor A/P         |
| Payment Done     | Dr: Vendor A/P, Cr: Bank                 |

## ✅ BENEFITS OF THIS FLOW

| Benefit                | Why It Matters                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Full Traceability      | Each process and vendor is tracked          |
| Sequential Control     | You can't skip steps accidentally           |
| Quality Assurance      | Inspection at every GRN                     |
| Accurate Costing       | Material + labor costs tracked step-wise    |
| WIP Management         | Real-time view of where material is located |
| GST & Audit Compliance | Separate GRN/Invoice/Payment vouchers       |

## 🔎 Example Flow (Visual)

```text
Job Work Order: Mounted Plate (100 qty)

1️⃣ JW-001-A → Cutting (Vendor A) → GRN-A → Inspection → Accepted
2️⃣ JW-001-B → Notching (Vendor B) → GRN-B → Inspection → Accepted
3️⃣ JW-001-C → Zinc Plating (Vendor C) → GRN-C → Final Inspection → Ready
```
