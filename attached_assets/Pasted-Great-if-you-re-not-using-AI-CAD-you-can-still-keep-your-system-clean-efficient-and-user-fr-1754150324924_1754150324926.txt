## ✅🔗 How It Will Work in Your System (Without AI CAD)

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Flow

| Step | Module            | Action & Impact                                                          |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1️⃣  | **PO Form**       | You create PO → Items, quantity, rate, destination                       |
| 2️⃣  | **PO Approved**   | Admin/Owner approves the PO → status set to "Approved"                   |
| 3️⃣  | **GRN Created**   | Vendor sends items → GRN created → inventory updates by batch & state    |
| 4️⃣  | **Inventory**     | Stock is added to correct state (Raw / WIP / Finished), tracked by batch |
| 5️⃣  | **Accounting**    | Journal entry auto-generated: Inventory debit, Vendor credit             |
| 6️⃣  | **Vendor Ledger** | Vendor balance increased by GRN value                                    |
| 7️⃣  | **Payment**       | When you pay vendor → new entry: Vendor debit, Bank credit               |
| 8️⃣  | **Invoice**       | If it's a sale, generate customer invoice with items & taxes             |

## 📦 Inventory Updates – Without CAD

* **Item Added in PO** → system pulls:

  * Unit weight
  * HSN Code / GST
  * Destination: Raw/WIP/FG
* **GRN** adds to `inventory_batches` table
* Example:

  ```
  Batch: MS-2025-005
  Item: MS Sheet
  Qty: 48
  Value: ₹144,000
  UOM: kg
  ```

## 🧾 Accounting Integration Summary

| Event         | Debit            | Credit          |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| PO Approved   | No entry yet     | No entry        |
| GRN Created   | Inventory (Item) | Vendor Account  |
| Bill Posted   | Accounts Payable | Vendor          |

---

## 🧮 Journal Entry Generator Logic (Auto)

```python
def generate_journal_entry_for_grn(grn):
    item_total = sum(item.qty * item.rate for item in grn.items)
    return {
        "entries": [
            {"account": f"Inventory - {grn.item_name}", "type": "debit", "amount": item_total},
            {"account": f"Vendor - {grn.vendor_name}", "type": "credit", "amount": item_total}
        ],
        "ref": f"GRN-{grn.id}",
        "date": grn.date
    }
```
