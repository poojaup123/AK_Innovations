Here is a **complete explanation** of the **Job Work process integrated with Production, GRN, and Batch Tracking**, illustrated with a **flowchart-style breakdown**, and covering **in-house & outsourced processes**, **phantom BOMs**, **multi-process routing**, **partial jobs**, and **accounting integration**.
  
### ✅ Real-World Example: **Castor Wheel Production**
 
#### 🔧 **Product:** Castor Wheel
 
#### 🔄 **BOM Structure:**
 
 
- **Mounted Plate** (processed **in-house**)
 
- **Base Plate** (processed **externally**, **phantom BOM**)

## 🔍 MODULE-WISE EXPLANATION
 
### 1. 🔨 **Production Order**
 
 
- You initiate a production order for the final product (e.g. Castor Wheel).
 
- The system explodes the **multi-level BOM** and identifies all sub-components.
 

  
### 2. 📋 **Job Work Order**
 
 
- Separate **Job Cards** are generated for each process: 
 
  - In-house → Handled by production teams
 
  - Outsourced → Sent to vendor (with Gate Pass)
 

 
 
- Allows **multi-step routing** (e.g., Cutting → Plating)
 
- Track: 
 
  - Vendor / Department
 
  - Status per process (Pending / In-Progress / Complete)
 
  - Quantity issued, returned (partial allowed)
 

 
 

  
### 3. 🏭 **In-House Job Processing**
 
 
- No GRN needed
 
- Output logged directly via **Production Entry**
 
- Batch updated
 
- Cost added to the production job
 

  
### 4. 🚚 **Outsourced Job Work**
 
 
- Raw material issued (batch-tracked)
 
- GRN required when job is returned: 
 
  - ✅ **3-Step GRN** 
 
    - Step 1: **Material Receipt** 
 
      - Inventory batch created
 
      - Job status partially/fully updated
 

 
 
    - Step 2: **Invoice Received** 
 
      - Matches price/qty with GRN
 
      - Credit GRN Clearing, Debit Payables
 

 
 
    - Step 3: **Payment** 
 
      - Final payment entry
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
- Supports: 
 
  - Partial receipts
 
  - Scrap / rejected parts
 
  - Multi-process/multi-vendor job completion
 

 
 

  
### 5. ⚙️ **Assembly & Completion**
 
 
- Once all components are available: 
 
  - Phantom BOMs are auto-consumed
 
  - Final Assembly logged under production
 

 
 
- Finished Goods batch is created
 
- Production order is marked as complete
 

  
### 6. 🧮 **Costing & Accounting**
 
 
- Cost per unit calculated from: 
 
  - Raw materials
 
  - Job work cost (labor + vendor invoice)
 
  - Overheads
 
  - Scrap wastage
 

 
 
- Automatically updates: 
 
  - Inventory valuation
 
  - Vendor payables
 
  - Job-wise costing reports
 

 
 

  
### 7. 📦 **Batch-Wise Tracking**
 
 
- Every issued/received item is tied to a batch
 
- Batches are updated: 
 
  - At material issue (raw)
 
  - At GRN (processed)
 
  - At production completion (output)
 

 
 
- Enables full traceability and QC
 

  
## 📊 Reports You Can Generate
 
 
- Job Work Status (by product, vendor, process)
 
- Pending GRNs
 
- In-house vs. Outsourced Cost Comparison
 
- Process-Wise Output
 
- Scrap & Rejection Report
 
- Vendor Performance
 
- Multi-step Timeline Tracking
