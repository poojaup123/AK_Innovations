## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide: Import Tally Master Data

### 🧾 1. **Export Data from Tally**

Tally allows exporting data in multiple formats:

| Data Type       | Export From       | Format to Use   |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Items / Stock   | Inventory Masters | XML or Excel    |
| Ledgers         | Accounts Masters  | XML or Excel    |
| UOMs            | Units of Measure  | Excel preferred |
| GST / Tax Rates | Statutory Masters | XML/Excel       |

> 📌 **Recommended Format**: Excel (.xls/.xlsx) for easy mapping

### ⚙️ 2. **Sample Export Fields from Tally**

| Tally Master Type | Common Fields Exported                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Item Master       | Name, Alias, Group, Units, GST Rate, Opening Balance     |
| Ledger Master     | Name, Ledger Group, GSTIN, Opening Balance, Type (Party) |
| UOM               | Unit Name, Symbol, Decimal Places                        |
| Tax Rates         | Name, Percentage, Ledger Linked                          |

---

### 🔁 3. **Map to Your App’s Models**

Create a mapping structure like:

#### 🧱 Inventory Item Mapping

| Tally Field | App Field            |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Name        | `item.name`          |
| Units       | `item.uom_id`        |
| GST Rate    | `item.gst_rate`      |
| Opening Qty | `item.opening_stock` |
| Value       | `item.opening_value` |

#### 🧾 Ledger Mapping

| Tally Field     | App Field        |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Ledger Name     | `ledger.name`    |
| Ledger Group    | `ledger.type`    |
| Opening Balance | `ledger.opening` |
| GSTIN           | `ledger.gstin`   |

---

### 🛠️ 4. **Import Tools in Your App**

Add an **“Import Master Data”** feature under `Settings > Tally Integration`:

* ✅ Upload Excel or XML
* ✅ Show preview & allow column mapping
* ✅ Validate data (e.g., UOM must exist, GST valid)
* ✅ Save into your tables

---

### 🧪 5. **Validation Logic**

* ✔ Skip duplicates or update
* ✔ Warn if UOM not matched
* ✔ GST % must be valid (0%, 5%, 12%, etc.)
* ✔ Ledger names must be unique within type

---

## 🔄 Optional: XML Parsing (if using XML)

Tally XML format can be read using Python `xml.etree.ElementTree` or `BeautifulSoup`.

Sample XML tag for stock item:

```xml
<STOCKITEM NAME="MS SHEET">
  <BASICUNITS>Kgs</BASICUNITS>
  <GSTDETAILS>
    <GST_RATE>18</GST_RATE>
  </GSTDETAILS>
</STOCKITEM>
```

## ✅ Suggested Import Flow

```
[Settings]
   └── [Tally Integration]
           └── [Import Master Data]
                     ├── Upload File (.xls or .xml)
                     ├── Preview Mapping
                     ├── Import & Confirm
                     └── View Import Logs
```

---

### ✅ Key Benefits

* No need to re-enter master data
* Keeps your factory system synced with Tally
* Reduces errors in naming, UOMs, GST, ledgers
