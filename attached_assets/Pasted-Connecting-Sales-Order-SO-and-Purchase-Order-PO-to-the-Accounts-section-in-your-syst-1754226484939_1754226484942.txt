Connecting **Sales Order (SO)** and **Purchase Order (PO)** to the **Accounts section** in your system enables automated **voucher generation**, **ledger updates**, and **tax handling** â€” just like in a full ERP or Tally-like system.

Letâ€™s break it down **step by step**:

---

## ðŸ”„ FLOW 1: **Purchase Order â†’ Accounts Integration**

### ðŸ§¾ When PO is Created:

* No accounting entry is made yet.
* Status: **Planned procurement**

> Just saves the intent to buy.

---

### ðŸ“¦ When GRN is Created (Partial or Full):

#### ðŸ“˜ Journal Entry: **Purchase Voucher**

| Ledger                   | Dr / Cr | Amount       |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------ |
| Inventory - Raw Material | Dr      | â‚¹XXX (Value) |
| GRN Clearing A/c         | Cr      | â‚¹XXX         |

> Inventory value increases â†’ this is a system voucher to record receipt.

---

### ðŸ§¾ When Invoice is Received:

#### ðŸ“˜ Journal Entry: **Vendor Invoice Voucher**

| Ledger           | Dr / Cr | Amount     |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| GRN Clearing A/c | Dr      | â‚¹XXX       |
| GST Input A/c    | Dr      | â‚¹XXX (tax) |
| Vendor A/c       | Cr      | â‚¹XXX + tax |

> Settles GRN clearing, adds vendor payable and tax credit.

---

### ðŸ’µ When Payment is Made:

#### ðŸ“˜ Journal Entry: **Payment Voucher**

| Ledger     | Dr / Cr | Amount |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ |
| Vendor A/c | Dr      | â‚¹XXX   |
| Bank A/c   | Cr      | â‚¹XXX   |

> Vendor balance is cleared, bank is reduced.

---

## ðŸ”„ FLOW 2: **Sales Order â†’ Accounts Integration**

### ðŸ“‹ When Sales Order is Created:

* No journal entry yet â€” just booked demand.

---

### ðŸšš When Material is Delivered (Outward):

#### ðŸ“˜ Journal Entry: **Stock Out (COGS)**

| Ledger                     | Dr / Cr | Amount |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)  | Dr      | â‚¹XXX   |
| Inventory - Finished Goods | Cr      | â‚¹XXX   |

> Moves finished goods to cost account.

---

### ðŸ§¾ When Invoice is Raised:

#### ðŸ“˜ Journal Entry: **Sales Invoice Voucher**

| Ledger         | Dr / Cr | Amount     |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Customer A/c   | Dr      | â‚¹XXX + GST |
| Sales A/c      | Cr      | â‚¹XXX       |
| GST Output A/c | Cr      | â‚¹XXX       |

> Customer becomes receivable, revenue and GST are booked.

---

### ðŸ’° When Customer Pays:

#### ðŸ“˜ Journal Entry: **Receipt Voucher**

| Ledger       | Dr / Cr | Amount |
| ------------ | ------- | ------ |
| Bank A/c     | Dr      | â‚¹XXX   |
| Customer A/c | Cr      | â‚¹XXX   |

> Payment is received and customer balance is cleared.

## ðŸ“Š Reports Auto-Generated from These Entries

| Report Type             | Data Source                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Purchase Register       | From GRNs + Vendor Invoices |
| Sales Register          | From Sales Invoices         |

## ðŸ”„ System Automation Logic

| Event              | Auto Trigger                                   |

| Advance Payments   | Can auto-adjust with invoice                   |

## ðŸ’¡ BONUS: Voucher Linkage

Every voucher should be traceable like this:

```
PO â†’ GRN â†’ Vendor Invoice â†’ Payment
         â†“
     Inventory Updated

SO â†’ Delivery â†’ Sales Invoice â†’ Receipt
                     â†“
                 COGS Booked
```

Would you like a **UI layout** for this linkage or want help building the **voucher generator engine** in your app?
