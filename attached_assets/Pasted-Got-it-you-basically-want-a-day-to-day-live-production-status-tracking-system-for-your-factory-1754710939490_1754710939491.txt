Got it ‚Äî you basically want a **day-to-day live production status tracking system** for your factory so you always know:

* What‚Äôs pending, in progress, and completed
* Which batches are at which stage
* How much quantity has been made today vs. planned
* Scrap, rework, and delays

Here‚Äôs how we can set it up in your app so it works for **in-house jobs, outsourced jobs, and full production orders**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **How Day-to-Day Production Status is Updated**

### **1. Break Down by Job Card**

Every **production order** generates **job cards** for sub-components and processes.
Each job card has:

* Process steps (routing)
* Planned vs. actual quantities
* Assigned worker/vendor
* Target completion date

---

### **2. Daily Production Entry**

Instead of only updating at the end, workers or supervisors log **daily production updates**:

| Field              | Example                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Date               | 2025-08-09                  |
| Job Card ID        | JW-2025-001                 |
| Process Name       | Cutting                     |
| Input Batch        | RAW-2025-0002               |
| Quantity Completed | 50                          |
| Scrap / Rework     | 2                           |
| Worker / Dept      | Cutting Dept / Machine A    |
| Remarks            | Machine stopped for 30 mins |

‚úÖ Each day‚Äôs entry updates:

* Job progress (% complete)
* WIP quantity
* Cumulative production vs. plan
* Scrap tally
* Batch status

---

### **3. How Status Changes Automatically**

* **Pending ‚Üí In Progress** when first daily entry is logged
* **In Progress ‚Üí Completed** when output = planned qty (or marked complete manually)
* **Completed** triggers:

  * Batch update
  * Cost roll-up
  * Move to next routing step or final assembly

---

### **4. Real-Time Dashboard**

A live dashboard shows **all jobs for today**:

| Job Card | Process  | Planned Qty | Today‚Äôs Qty | Total Done | Status      |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| JW-001   | Cutting  | 100         | 50          | 50         | In Progress |
| JW-002   | Plating  | 200         | 200         | 200        | Completed   |
| JW-003   | Assembly | 50          | 0           | 0          | Pending     |

---

### **5. Outsourced vs. In-House Tracking**

* **In-House** ‚Üí Status comes from daily production entry form
* **Outsourced** ‚Üí Status comes from:

  * **GRN** (when goods arrive from vendor)
  * **Partial receipts** update daily if vendor sends in batches

---

### **6. Batch & QC Link**

* Each daily update is linked to **input batch** and generates **output batch**
* QC can approve/reject immediately after update
* Scrap batches logged automatically

---

## üîÑ **Daily Update Cycle**

```
Morning:
- Supervisors open "Today's Jobs" screen
- Assign workers & machines

Throughout the Day:
- Operators log quantities at shift intervals
- Scrap and rework captured immediately

End of Day:
- Supervisor reviews all updates
- Approves day‚Äôs production log
- Dashboard auto-refreshes for management
```

---

## üìå **Database Tracking**

We‚Äôll have a **`production_daily_log`** table:

| Field                | Type    |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| log\_id              | PK      |
| job\_card\_id        | FK      |
| process\_id          | FK      |
| date                 | Date    |
| qty\_completed       | Integer |
| qty\_scrap           | Integer |
| worker\_id           | FK      |
| remarks              | Text    |
| status\_after\_entry | Enum    |

This table powers:

* Daily production report
* Delay analysis
* Scrap trends
* Efficiency metrics

## üñ•Ô∏è **Example Flask/Jinja2 Update Screen**

```html
<h3>Daily Production Entry</h3>
<form method="post" action="/production/update">
  <label>Job Card</label>
  <select name="job_card_id">
    {% for job in jobs_today %}
      <option value="{{ job.id }}">{{ job.name }} - {{ job.process }}</option>
    {% endfor %}
  </select>

  <label>Quantity Completed</label>
  <input type="number" name="qty_completed" required>

  <label>Scrap</label>
  <input type="number" name="qty_scrap" value="0">

  <label>Remarks</label>
  <textarea name="remarks"></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Update</button>
</form>
```

---

## üìä Reports Possible

* **Daily Production Report** (planned vs. actual for the day)
* **WIP Report** (how many parts are mid-process)
* **Delay Report** (jobs not meeting daily targets)
* **Scrap Report** (by process, by day)
* **Efficiency Report** (output vs. man-hours/machine-hours)
