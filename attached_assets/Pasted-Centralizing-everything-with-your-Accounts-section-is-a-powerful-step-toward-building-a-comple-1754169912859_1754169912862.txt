Centralizing everything with your **Accounts section** is a powerful step toward building a **complete ERP-like system**. Here’s a full breakdown of how your **centralized accounting module** will now **interact with other modules** like Inventory, Job Work, GRN, BOM, and Production:
  
### ✅ **1. Centralized Accounting: The Core**
 
Everything now feeds into your **Accounts** module for:
 
 
- **Ledger entries**
 
- **Automatic journal vouchers**
 
- **Real-time cost tracking**
 
- **Profit & loss analysis**
 
- **Tax/GST tracking**
 
- **Vendor/customer balance tracking**
 

  
### 🔗 **2. Module-wise Integration with Accounts**
 
#### 📦 **Inventory**
 
 
- Purchases (via GRN) → triggers: 
 
  - Inventory asset increase
 
  - Purchase ledger debit
 
  - Vendor payable credit
 

 
 
- Stock issue (Job Work/Production) → triggers: 
 
  - Inventory decrease
 
  - WIP ledger debit
 
  - Inventory credit (consumed)
 

 
 

 
#### 🧾 **GRN (Goods Receipt Note)**
 
 
- GRN receipt (PO/Job Work): 
 
  - Debit: Inventory or WIP
 
  - Credit: GRN clearing or supplier account
 
  - Add freight/taxes to landed cost automatically
 

 
 

 
#### ⚙️ **Job Work**
 
 
- Job work sent → record: 
 
  - Inventory transfer (not ownership)
 
  - Track advance payments if paid
 

 
 
- Job work received (via GRN): 
 
  - Debit: Finished Goods/WIP
 
  - Credit: Job Work Vendor
 
  - Option to auto-book job work expense
 

 
 

 
#### 🧰 **Production**
 
 
- Production completed → trigger: 
 
  - Debit: Finished Goods Inventory
 
  - Credit: Raw Material/WIP
 
  - Optional: Machine cost, labor cost → move to COGS ledger
 

 
 

 
#### 📘 **BOM**
 
 
- Used as a cost reference for: 
 
  - Job Work planning
 
  - Material costing (Inventory valuation)
 
  - Machine & labor costing per product (Cost sheet generation)
 

 
 

 
#### 🏷️ **Sales**
 
 
- SO → Invoice: 
 
  - Debit: Customer
 
  - Credit: Sales, GST
 

 
 
- Stock out: 
 
  - Inventory ↓, COGS ↑
 

 
 

 
#### 👥 **Payroll**
 
 
- Salary processed: 
 
  - Debit: Wages, Factory Overheads
 
  - Credit: Cash/Bank, Advances
