Absolutely! Here's a **complete and step-by-step explanation** of how your **batch-wise job work system** should function — across **issue, return, inventory, and reports** — including all the updates needed in your app.

---

# ✅ 1. OVERVIEW: What Is Batch-wise Job Work?

**Job Work** = You send raw material to a vendor → vendor returns finished products
**Batch-wise tracking** = You track:

* Which **input batch** was used
* What **output batch** was created
* How much was **scrapped**
* How much was **unused and returned**

This enables **full traceability**, **inventory accuracy**, and **reporting**.

---

# 🔁 2. FLOW BREAKDOWN: Step-by-Step

## 🔷 STEP 1: GRN / Batch Creation

When raw material is received, you:

* Create a **batch** (e.g., `MS-001`)
* Enter details: Item, Quantity, Mfg Date, UOM, etc.
* Add to Inventory with state: `Raw`

🛠 **Change Required:**

* GRN form must capture `batch_code`, `qty`, `uom`, `expiry`, etc.
* Inventory must allow viewing stock **per batch**

---

## 🔷 STEP 2: Job Work Issue (Raw Material)

You send raw material to vendor:

* Select `Item`: MS Sheet
* Select `Batch`: MS-001
* Issue: 5 sheets
* Link to Job Work ID: JW-1001

🛠 **Change Required:**

* Job Work form must:

  * Allow **batch selection**
  * Deduct issued quantity from `Raw` state
  * Move quantity to `WIP` state under batch

🧾 Example:

| Field       | Value      |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Job Work ID | JW-1001    |
| Item        | MS Sheet   |
| Batch       | MS-001     |
| Qty Issued  | 5 Sheets   |
| Send Date   | 2025-08-01 |
| Vendor      | Vendor-A   |

---

## 🔷 STEP 3: Job Work Return (Output)

Vendor returns:

* 500 pcs of Mounted Plate
* Output batch: FG-001
* Scrap: 20 pcs
* Unused raw: 2 sheets

🛠 **Change Required:**

* Job Work Return form must:

  * Capture new **output batch ID**
  * Allow entry of **scrap qty**
  * Allow return of **unused input batch qty**
  * Automatically:

    * Create new batch: `FG-001` with 500 pcs
    * Move 2 sheets back to `MS-001` → Raw
    * Log 20 pcs as `Scrap` → new batch or scrap flag

🧾 Job Work Return Table:

| Field          | Value         |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Job Work ID    | JW-1001       |
| Output Product | Mounted Plate |
| Output Batch   | FG-001        |
| Qty Produced   | 500 pcs       |
| Scrap Qty      | 20 pcs        |
| Return Unused  | 2 sheets      |
| Input Batch    | MS-001        |

---

## 🔷 STEP 4: Inventory Update

Inventory batches will now look like:

| Item                  | Batch        | Raw | WIP | Finished | Scrap |
| --------------------- | ------------ | --- | --- | -------- | ----- |
| MS Sheet              | MS-001       | 17  | 0   | 0        | 0     |
| Mounted Plate         | FG-001       | 0   | 0   | 500      | 0     |
| Scrap (Mounted Plate) | SCRAP-JW1001 | 0   | 0   | 0        | 20    |

🛠 **Change Required:**

* Inventory system must support **batch + state** tracking (raw/WIP/finished/scrap)
* Automatic adjustments after job work return

---

## 🔷 STEP 5: Reports & Traceability

### 📊 Reports you can now generate:

| Report Type             | Description                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Batch Usage Report**  | Which batches were used in which job works  |
| **Yield Report**        | Input qty → output qty → scrap → efficiency |
| **Scrap Report**        | How much was scrapped by batch/job/vendor   |
| **Batch Ageing Report** | How old are active batches                  |
| **Vendor Performance**  | Scrap % per job work or vendor              |

🛠 **Change Required:**

* Add filters for `batch_id`, `jobwork_id`, `date_range`, etc.
* Link batch flows across Job Work, GRN, and Inventory

# 📘 REQUIRED TABLE STRUCTURE (Simplified)

### `inventory_batches`

```text
id | item_id | batch_code | qty | state | uom | location | created_at
```

### `jobwork_records`

```text
id | jobwork_id | item_id | input_batch_id | issued_qty | vendor_id | status
```

### `jobwork_returns`

```text
id | jobwork_id | output_product | output_batch | output_qty | scrap_qty | return_unused_qty | return_date
```

### `inventory_movements`

```text
id | item_id | batch_id | from_state | to_state | qty | ref_type | ref_id | timestamp
```
