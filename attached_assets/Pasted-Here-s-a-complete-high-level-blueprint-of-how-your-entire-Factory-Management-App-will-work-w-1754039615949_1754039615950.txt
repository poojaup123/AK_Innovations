Here’s a **complete high-level blueprint** of how your entire **Factory Management App** will work with **Batch-Wise Tracking** — module by module, showing how everything is connected and flows together.

## 🏭 **AK Innovations Factory Management App (With Batch-Wise Tracking)**

### 🧱 **CORE ENTITIES INVOLVED**

| Entity            | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Item Master`     | Holds item details, default UOM, batch flag    |
| `UOM Table`       | Unit conversion, standard base for calculation |
| `Inventory Batch` | Every raw/output item tracked by batch         |
| `Job Work`        | Tracks material sent and returned              |
| `Production`      | Tracks internal manufacturing                  |
| `GRN`             | Captures received materials (with batch)       |
| `Dispatch/Sales`  | Sends output products (by batch)               |
| `Scrap`           | Tracks defectives or unusable stock            |

---

## 🔁 **COMPLETE APP FLOW (End-to-End with Batch)**

---

### 🔹 1. **Item Creation (Master)**

* Create item: e.g., *MS Sheet*, *Mounted Plate*
* Define:

  * Default UOM (e.g., sheet, pcs)
  * Batch Required: ✅ Yes/No

---

### 🔹 2. **GRN (Goods Receipt Note)**

* Receive items from vendors
* For each item:

  * Create Batch Code (e.g., `MS-001`)
  * UOM + Qty (e.g., 20 sheets)
  * State = `Raw`

✅ **Inventory Batch created** with:
`MS-001 → 20 sheets → Raw`

---

### 🔹 3. **Inventory Dashboard**

Shows for each item:

| Item          | Batch Code | Qty | UOM   | State              |
| ------------- | ---------- | --- | ----- | ------------------ |
| MS Sheet      | MS-001     | 20  | Sheet | Raw                |
| -             | -          | 5   | Sheet | WIP (issued to JW) |
| Mounted Plate | FG-001     | 500 | Pcs   | Finished           |

You can track state-wise breakdown: Raw, WIP, Finished, Scrap

---

### 🔹 4. **Job Work - Issue**

* Select item: *MS Sheet*
* Select batch: `MS-001`
* Issue qty: 5 sheets
* Select vendor

✅ System action:

* Deduct 5 from `Raw`
* Add 5 to `WIP` under same batch

---

### 🔹 5. **Job Work - Return**

* Job Work ID: JW-1001
* Output:

  * Product: *Mounted Plate*
  * Output Batch: `FG-001`
  * Produced: 500 pcs
  * Scrap: 20 pcs
  * Unused Raw Returned: 2 sheets

✅ System action:

* Create new batch `FG-001` → 500 pcs → `Finished`
* Scrap batch `SCRAP-JW1001` → 20 pcs → `Scrap`
* Add 2 sheets back to `MS-001` → `Raw`

---

### 🔹 6. **Production (Optional or Parallel to Job Work)**

* Select raw batch
* Record finished product batch (FG)
* Record scrap + unused

Same logic as Job Work, but internal.

---

### 🔹 7. **Dispatch (Sales Order Fulfillment)**

* Select output item (e.g., Mounted Plate)
* System shows:

  * Available batch: `FG-001`, 500 pcs
* Select qty (e.g., 300 pcs)
* Dispatch

✅ System deducts from Finished batch.

---

### 🔹 8. **Scrap Handling**

* Track scrap batches per job/production
* Separate section for reprocessing or disposal

---

### 🔹 9. **Batch Movement Ledger**

Every action creates a movement log:

| Ref Type  | Ref ID  | From State | To State | Item          | Batch  | Qty |
| --------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------- | ------ | --- |
| GRN       | GRN-001 | None       | Raw      | MS Sheet      | MS-001 | 20  |
| Job Work  | JW-1001 | Raw        | WIP      | MS Sheet      | MS-001 | 5   |
| JW Return | JW-1001 | WIP        | Finished | Mounted Plate | FG-001 | 500 |

---

## 📊 **REPORTING INTEGRATION**

| Report                 | Uses Batch Data      |

## 🔁 MODULE-WISE CONNECTION WITH BATCH

| Module     | Uses Batch? | How it interacts                                 |

| Job Work   | ✅           | Issues from input batch, returns to output batch |
| Production | ✅           | Consumes input batch, generates output batch     |
| Dispatch   | ✅           | Picks from finished batch                        |
| Scrap      | ✅           | Tagged against jobwork or production batch       |
| Reporting  | ✅           | Filters, traceability, audits                    |
