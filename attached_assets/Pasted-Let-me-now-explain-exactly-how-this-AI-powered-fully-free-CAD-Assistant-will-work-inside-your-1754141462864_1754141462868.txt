Let me now explain exactly **how this AI-powered, fully free CAD Assistant** will work **inside your existing factory management system** (built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc.), and how it will interact with your BOM, Job Work, and Inventory.

## 🏭 Your System + AI-CAD Assistant: Integration Plan

| Section           | What Happens                                 | CAD Assistant’s Role                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. BOM**        | You create BOM for product (e.g. Castor)     | Auto-extract BOM items from CAD file if uploaded     |
| **2. CAD Upload** | You upload `.stp` file for an item           | Auto-preview + store + analyze volume, drawing       |
| **3. Job Work**   | Job assigned to vendor (e.g. Cut MS sheet)   | CAD shows expected output shape/drawing for vendor   |
| **4. Inventory**  | You consume or receive parts                 | Uses CAD info (like volume) to calculate scrap/usage |
| **5. Reports**    | You analyze material usage, costs, revisions | AI links CAD + BOM + Job Work to generate insights   |
| **6. Accounting** | You log cost of job work (Rs/piece or Rs/kg) | Auto-calculate based on material volume (from CAD)   |

## 🔁 Real-World Workflow: Step-by-Step

Let’s walk through one full scenario from **upload to costing**:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Upload a CAD File (FreeCAD-compatible like `.stp`)

* User uploads file via BOM or Job Work section.
* Stored in DB or filesystem, linked to item.

**CAD Assistant:**

* FreeCAD parses file.
* Extracts:

  * Dimensions
  * Volume
  * Surface Area
* Shows live 3D preview using 3DViewer.net iframe.

---

### ✅ Step 2: User Types Natural Language Command

**Example:**

> “How many parts can we cut from 1 MS Sheet?”

**CAD Assistant:**

* LangChain (with LLaMA3 or Mistral via Ollama) understands intent.
* Calls FreeCAD + your scrap logic:

  * 1 MS sheet = 1m x 1m = 10000 cm²
  * CAD part = 25 cm²
  * So, 400 pieces per sheet

Returns:

> 💡 You can cut 400 pieces from 1 sheet. Estimated scrap: 5%.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Use in Job Work or Production

When raising a job work:

* CAD Assistant shows the output model (Mounted Plate)
* Optionally, exports 2D drawing (PDF) to attach for the vendor.

---

### ✅ Step 4: System Calculates Cost

* Volume × density × rate (Rs/kg)
* OR per-piece costing based on FreeCAD-calculated quantity.

> Example:
> CAD part volume: 50 cm³ → weight ≈ 0.4 kg
> MS Sheet cost: ₹80/kg → Cost per part ≈ ₹32

---

### ✅ Step 5: Updates to Inventory & BOM

* Material movement tracked batch-wise
* Job work GRN references output from CAD logic
* Final inventory record updated with:

  * Quantity
  * Estimated weight
  * CAD reference
  * Linked drawing
