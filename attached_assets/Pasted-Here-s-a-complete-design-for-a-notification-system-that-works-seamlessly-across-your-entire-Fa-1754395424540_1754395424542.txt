Here’s a complete design for a **notification system** that works **seamlessly across your entire Factory Management System**, using Flask and integrating with Email, SMS, and WhatsApp.

---

### ✅ Notification System Objectives

* Notify users/admins automatically on important actions
* Centralize all system messages (alerts, approvals, warnings)
* Support **Email**, **SMS**, **WhatsApp**
* Configurable from **Settings panel**
* Log all notifications (sent, pending, failed)

## 🔧 Core Architecture Overview

### 📁 1. Database Tables

#### `NotificationLog`

| Field           | Type       | Description                      |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| id              | Integer    | Primary Key                      |
| user\_id        | ForeignKey | Target user                      |
| message         | Text       | Message content                  |
| channel         | String     | `email`, `sms`, `whatsapp`       |
| status          | String     | `pending`, `sent`, `failed`      |
| related\_module | String     | `po`, `grn`, `production`, etc.  |
| related\_id     | Integer    | ID of the PO/GRN/Production/etc. |
| created\_at     | DateTime   | Timestamp                        |

#### `NotificationSettings`

| Field    | Type    | Description                             |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| module   | String  | `po`, `grn`, `production`, `hr`, etc.   |
| event    | String  | `created`, `approved`, `rejected`, etc. |
| enabled  | Boolean | Enable/Disable                          |
| channel  | String  | email/sms/whatsapp                      |
| template | Text    | Message template with placeholders      |

## 🔁 2. Trigger Points for Notifications

| Module         | Event                    | Trigger                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Purchase Order | PO Created / Approved    | Notify vendor/admin              |
| GRN            | Material Received        | Notify purchase team             |
| Job Work       | Job Work Issued          | Notify vendor + QC head          |
| Production     | Production Completed     | Notify stores + update inventory |
| HR             | Salary Paid / Attendance | Notify employee                  |
| Inventory      | Reorder Level Reached    | Notify store admin               |
| Accounting     | Voucher Created          | Notify finance lead              |

## ⚙️ 3. How It Works Internally (Flow)

1. **Event Occurs** (e.g. PO Created)
2. Backend checks `NotificationSettings` for:

   * Is notification enabled for this event/module?
   * Which channels to use?
3. **Message is prepared** using a Jinja2-style template
4. A record is added to `NotificationLog` with `pending` status
5. Notification Worker (or cron) sends it
6. Status is updated to `sent` or `failed`

---

## 📬 4. Example Notification Templates

```txt
PO Created: 
New PO (PO-2025-0003) for {{ supplier_name }} worth ₹{{ amount }} has been created on {{ created_date }}.
```

```txt
Salary Paid:
Dear {{ employee_name }}, salary ₹{{ amount }} for {{ pay_period }} has been credited via {{ payment_method }}.
```

---

## 🛠️ 5. Notification Sender Logic (Python)

Create a `services/notifications.py`:

```python
def send_notification(channel, message, recipient):
    if channel == 'email':
        send_email(message, recipient.email)
    elif channel == 'sms':
        send_sms(message, recipient.phone)
    elif channel == 'whatsapp':
        send_whatsapp(message, recipient.phone)
```

---

## 🧠 6. Settings Panel UI

In your **Settings > Notifications** panel:

* Show a list of modules and events
* Allow enabling/disabling channels
* Allow editing templates
* Test send option

---

## 📊 7. Notification Center (Admin Panel)

| Column    | Description             |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| Message   | Preview of message sent |
| Module    | Module like PO, GRN, HR |
| Channel   | email / sms / whatsapp  |
| Recipient | Name and phone/email    |
| Status    | sent / failed / pending |
| Timestamp | When sent               |
