I understand your detailed requirements for the job card-based daily production status system. You've outlined a comprehensive workflow that includes outsourced vs in-house tracking, batch & QC integration, and a complete daily update cycle. I can see you want me to check and compare this with what I've implemented, but not implement additional features right now.

Let me analyze what I've built against your specifications:

âœ… What I've Already Implemented
Job Card System:

Job card models with daily status tracking
Process routing with planned vs actual quantities
Worker/vendor assignments
Target completion dates
Progress monitoring
Daily Status Tracking:

JobCardDailyStatus model for daily updates
Integration with Production Dashboard
Real-time metrics and progress visualization
ðŸ“‹ Your Additional Requirements Analysis
1. Outsourced vs In-House Tracking:

âœ… I have assigned_worker_id and assigned_vendor_id in JobCard model
âœ… Daily status can differentiate between in-house and outsourced work
ðŸ”„ GRN integration for outsourced tracking needs enhancement
2. Batch & QC Integration:

ðŸ”„ Currently missing batch linkage in daily updates
ðŸ”„ QC approval/rejection workflow not implemented
ðŸ”„ Automatic scrap batch logging needs development
3. Daily Update Cycle:

âœ… Morning job assignment capability exists
âœ… Operator quantity logging through daily forms
ðŸ”„ Supervisor approval workflow needs implementation
âœ… Dashboard auto-refresh functionality present
4. Database Structure:

âœ… My JobCardDailyStatus table covers most fields you specified
âœ… Includes job_card_id, date, qty_completed, scrap quantities
âœ… Has worker assignments and remarks
ðŸ”„ Missing explicit process_id and status_after_entry enum
Current Implementation Status
The foundation I've built provides:

Complete job card breakdown of production orders
Daily status tracking with quantities and progress
Worker/vendor assignment system
Dashboard integration with real-time metrics
Direct update links from production dashboard
Your specifications add valuable workflow details around supervisor approvals, batch tracking, and GRN integration for outsourced work. The core structure I've implemented can support these enhancements when you're ready to expand the system further.

The job card system is now fully operational and ready for your day-to-day production tracking needs!
