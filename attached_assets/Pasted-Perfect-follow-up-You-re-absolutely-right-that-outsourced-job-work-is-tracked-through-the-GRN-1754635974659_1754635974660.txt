Perfect follow-up. You're absolutely right that **outsourced job work** is tracked through the **GRN (Goods Receipt Note)** process ‚Äî but the **in-house job work and production** follow a *different yet fully integrated tracking flow*.

### üîç Let's break it down:

> üìå **Key Comparison**
> \|                         | **Outsourced Job Work**              | **In-House Job Work / Production**           |
> \|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
> \| Tracking Trigger        | GRN (Goods Receipt Note)             | Production Entry Form                        |
> \| Receipts Managed via   | Vendor GRN (3-Step)                  | Process Completion Logs (per routing step)   |
> \| Inventory Update       | On GRN Completion                     | On Production Entry                          |
> \| Cost Entry             | Via Vendor Invoice                    | Via internal cost calculation (labor, scrap) |
> \| Batch Tracking         | On Material Issue + GRN               | On Material Issue + Production Output        |
> \| Scrap Capture          | On GRN                                | On Production Entry                          |
> \| Accounting Integration | Payables via GRN                      | Internal job costing + consumption           |

## ‚úÖ IN-HOUSE JOB WORK TRACKING FLOW

Let‚Äôs take **Mounted Plate (in-house)** as the working example.

```
[ Production Order Created ]
          ‚Üì
[ BOM Identifies "Mounted Plate" as In-House Job ]
          ‚Üì
[ Job Work Card Generated for Mounted Plate ]
          ‚Üì
[ Routing Assigned: Cutting ‚Üí Notching ‚Üí Plating ]
          ‚Üì
[ RM Issued (Batch-wise) from Inventory ]
          ‚Üì
[ Each Step Tracked via Production Entry Form ]
          ‚Üì
[ At Completion of Final Step ‚Üí Output Batch Created ]
          ‚Üì
[ Inventory Updated + Cost Calculated ]
```

### üî® HOW SYSTEM TRACKS IN-HOUSE JOB WORK

#### ‚úÖ 1. **Routing-Based Progress**

Each in-house job follows **routing**:

* Operator logs completion for each process (with qty, time, scrap)
* Status is updated per process step
* UI shows live job progress

#### ‚úÖ 2. **Production Entry Form**

Instead of GRN, internal jobs use a **Production Entry** form:

| Field                | Example       |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Job Work ID          | JW-2025-001   |
| Component            | Mounted Plate |
| Process              | Notching      |
| Input Batch          | RAW-2025-0002 |
| Output Quantity      | 98            |
| Scrap                | 2             |
| Output Batch Created | MP-2025-0001  |

‚úÖ Each entry updates:

* Job work progress
* Inventory (WIP ‚Üí FG)
* Batch register
* Costing module

#### ‚úÖ 3. **Batch Tracking**

* On **RM issue** ‚Üí Input batch is recorded
* On **production entry** ‚Üí Output batch is created
* Batches linked from RM ‚Üí Sub-part ‚Üí Final product

#### ‚úÖ 4. **Costing (No Invoice)**

Since it‚Äôs internal:

* No vendor invoice or GRN
* System auto-calculates cost using:

  * Material cost
  * Labor (manual input or estimated)
  * Machine hour rates (optional)
  * Overheads
  * Scrap loss

‚úÖ These costs are added to the parent production order.

#### ‚úÖ 5. **Inventory Update**

Once final step is complete:

* Output quantity is moved to **WIP or FG stock**
* Linked to production order (e.g., Castor Wheel)
* Available for next stage (assembly)

## üîÅ PRODUCTION TRACKING IN SYSTEM

1. **Job Card** is the tracking entity (per part/process)
2. **Routing Table** defines the steps
3. **Production Logs** are entered step-by-step
4. **Status auto-updates** as each step is marked completed
5. **Final Completion** triggers:

   * Batch creation
   * Cost roll-up
   * Inventory update
