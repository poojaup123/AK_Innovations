Great question — let's walk through **how inventory will behave step-by-step** when you're sending 50 out of 100 raw plates for **cutting + blanking**, and then receiving them back:

---

### 🔄 STEP-BY-STEP INVENTORY FLOW (Example: Mounted Plate)

You start with:

> 🏭 **Inventory: 100 Mounted Plates (Raw)**

---

### ✅ **1. Send 50 for Job Work (Cutting + Blanking)**

Action:
You raise a **Job Work Out** for 50 plates.

📦 Inventory impact:

| Inventory Category           | Qty |
| ---------------------------- | --- |
| Raw Material (Mounted Plate) | 50  |
| Under Process / WIP          | 50  |

So now:

* 50 plates still remain as raw stock
* 50 plates are **moved** to a separate “Under Process” status

You don’t lose them — just logically split the stock.

---

### ✅ **2. Receive Back 48 Plates (after job work)**

Let’s say 2 plates were **rejected or scrapped** during the process.

📦 Inventory impact:

| Inventory Category   | Qty |
| -------------------- | --- |
| Finished (Processed) | 48  |
| Scrap / Rejected     | 2   |
| Under Process / WIP  | -50 |

You now **remove 50 from WIP**, and **add 48 to Finished**, 2 to Scrap.

---

### 📊 FINAL INVENTORY STATUS

| Type                | Quantity |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Raw Material        | 50       |
| Finished Goods      | 48       |
| Scrap / Rejected    | 2        |
| Under Process (WIP) | 0        |

---

### 🧩 How to Track in Your App

In your system, you’ll maintain separate **logical stock statuses**, like:

| Table       | Field / Status Example |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `inventory` | `qty_raw` = 50         |
| `inventory` | `qty_wip` = 0          |
| `inventory` | `qty_finished` = 48    |
| `inventory` | `qty_scrap` = 2        |

OR track each transaction in an `inventory_movements` table with type:

* Job Work Out
* Job Work In
* Scrap
* Transfer

---

### 📦 Why This Is Powerful

1. 📉 You avoid mixing up raw and finished stock
2. 📋 You can see WIP at any time
3. 🔄 You can **reverse** or track any batch/job-wise stock
4. 🔍 Helps in precise cost + material traceability
