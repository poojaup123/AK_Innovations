Alright — let’s go deep into **how Job Cards will work in production** in your system.
Think of a **Job Card** as the “passport” for a part or process — it travels with the job from start to finish, carrying all its tracking info.

---

## 📌 **Definition**

A **Job Card** in production is a document/record that:

* Is **generated from the production order**
* Represents **one specific part or process** from the BOM
* Holds **all details required for execution**
* Tracks progress until the part is ready for the next stage

## 🔄 **How Job Cards Work in Your System**

### **1. Creation**

When you create a **Production Order**:

1. System explodes the **multi-level BOM**
2. For each sub-part and process, it generates **Job Cards**
3. Job Cards are tagged:

   * **Type**: In-house / Outsourced
   * **Process Routing**
   * **Batch linkage**
   * **Target quantity & dates**

Example for Castor Wheel:

| Job Card ID | Component     | Type       | Process Steps                |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| JC-001      | Mounted Plate | In-house   | Cutting → Notching → Plating |
| JC-002      | Base Plate    | Outsourced | Cutting → Plating            |

### **2. Contents of a Job Card**

A Job Card has:

* **Header**

  * Job Card ID
  * Production Order ID
  * Component name & code
  * Department / Vendor
  * Planned start & end date
  * Target qty
  * Batch numbers (input/output)
* **Routing Table**

  * Process sequence
  * Machine/worker assignments
  * Time estimates
* **Material Issue**

  * RM list with batch numbers
  * Qty issued
* **Daily Progress Logs**

  * Qty done
  * Scrap/rework qty
  * Operator name
* **Cost Tracking**

  * Labor time cost
  * Machine cost
  * Material cost
* **Status**

  * Pending / In Progress / Completed

---

### **3. Tracking in Production**

**In-House:**

* Supervisor opens the job card daily
* Logs process completions (per routing step)
* Logs scrap/rework immediately
* When all steps are done → Job Card status changes to **Completed**
* Output batch is created and moved to inventory

**Outsourced:**

* Job Card is linked to a **Job Work Order** + Gate Pass
* RM is issued batch-wise
* Status is “Pending GRN” until goods return
* GRN completion updates Job Card to “Completed”

---

### **4. Why Job Cards Are Important**

* **Central tracking point** for each part
* **Connects**:

  * BOM → Process routing → Material issue → Production log → Batch → Costing
* **Allows partial progress updates**
* **Simplifies reporting** (e.g., WIP status, delays, cost per part)
* **Supports parallel work** (multiple cards active at the same time for different parts)

---

### **5. Job Card Lifecycle**

```
[ Production Order Created ]
        ↓
[ BOM Exploded → Job Cards Generated ]
        ↓
[ Material Issued to Job Card (Batch Linked) ]
        ↓
[ Daily Process Updates Logged ]
        ↓
[ Scrap/Rework Recorded ]
        ↓
[ All Processes Completed → Output Batch Created ]
        ↓
[ Job Card Status: Completed ]
        ↓
[ Part Available for Next Stage (Assembly or Dispatch) ]
```

---

### **6. Real-World Example**

**Mounted Plate – JC-001**

* **Day 1:** Cutting done, 2 sheets scrapped → logged in job card
* **Day 2:** Notching done → progress updated to 70% complete
* **Day 3:** Plating done → job card marked as completed
* Output batch MP-2025-0001 generated
* Costing calculated: RM cost + labor + machine + scrap loss

---

### **7. UI Example – Job Card Screen (Flask/Jinja2)**

```html
<h3>Job Card: JC-001</h3>
<p>Component: Mounted Plate | Type: In-House | Qty Target: 100</p>
<p>Status: In Progress</p>

<h4>Routing</h4>
<table>
  <tr><th>Step</th><th>Machine</th><th>Status</th><th>Qty Done</th><th>Scrap</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Cutting</td><td>Laser-01</td><td>✅ Completed</td><td>100</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Notching</td><td>Press-02</td><td>✅ Completed</td><td>98</td><td>0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Plating</td><td>ZP-Tank-01</td><td>🕒 In Progress</td><td>50</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Material Issued</h4>
<ul>
  <li>CR Sheet – Batch: RAW-2025-0002 – Qty: 10 Sheets</li>
</ul>
```

## 🔑 **Key Benefits in Production**

* **Full traceability** (batch → job → output → cost)
* **Parallel tracking** for multiple jobs
* **Supports partial completion**
* **Links costing & accounting automatically**
* **Single source of truth** for production status

If you want, I can now prepare:

1. **Database schema** for job cards with routing & batch linkage
2. **Flask backend** to generate job cards from a production order automatically
3. **Live dashboard** showing all active job cards and their progress

Do you want me to make the **schema + generation logic** first so job cards start auto-generating from production orders? That’s the base for everything else.
