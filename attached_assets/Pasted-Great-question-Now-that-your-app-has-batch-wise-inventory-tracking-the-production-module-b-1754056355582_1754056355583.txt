Great question. Now that your app has **batch-wise inventory tracking**, the **production module** becomes smarter, more traceable, and better integrated.

Let’s break it down step-by-step to explain **how production will work now**:

---

## 🏭 **Production Flow with Batch-Wise Inventory**

### 📘 Use Case:

You're producing **Mounted Plate (ITEM-0001)** using **Ms Sheet (ITEM-0002)** in batches.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Flow

### 🔹 **Step 1: Create Production Order**

Fields:

* Production ID: `PRD-0001`
* Product to produce: `Mounted Plate`
* Quantity to produce: `500 pcs`
* Expected Scrap: `5%`
* Production Date: `01-08-2025`
* BOM: Auto fetched (if selected)
* Department / In-house team
* Target Completion Date

---

### 🔹 **Step 2: Select Raw Material Input**

From BOM, the system auto fetches required raw materials and their quantity based on UOM and batch.

Example:

* BOM requires 1 sheet = 10 pcs.
* You want to make 500 pcs → need 50 sheets.

You select from available batches:

| Batch ID | Item     | Qty Available | Select Qty |
| -------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| MS-001   | Ms Sheet | 78 sheets     | 50 sheets  |

System logs that **MS-001** batch is used.

---

### 🔹 **Step 3: Reserve & Consume Raw Material**

* Deduct 50 sheets from batch `MS-001`.
* Mark them as **WIP** under this production.
* Move from `Raw → WIP`.

📌 **Inventory Log Entry**

* `txn_type`: Production Consumption
* `from_state`: Raw
* `to_state`: WIP
* `ref_doc`: `PRD-0001`

---

### 🔹 **Step 4: Complete Production**

Once production is done:

* Enter output quantity: `490 pcs`
* Scrap: `10 pcs` (optional field)
* Select Output UOM: pcs
* Assign Finished Batch ID: `FG-001`

📌 Actions:

* Create **new batch**: `FG-001`
* Quantity: 490 pcs
* Location: `Finished Store`
* Move from WIP → Finished
* Scrap quantity added to Scrap state

📌 **Inventory Log Entry**

* `txn_type`: Production Complete
* `to_state`: Finished
* `ref_doc`: `PRD-0001`

📌 **Scrap Log Entry**

* Batch: `MS-001`
* Qty: 10 pcs
* Scrap Reason: e.g., Defective Cutting

---

### 🔹 **Step 5: Update Inventory Dashboard**

Automatically:

* Raw Material: -50 from `MS-001`
* WIP: -50
* Finished: +490 (FG-001)
* Scrap: +10

---

### 🗂 Batch Table Update

| Batch ID | Item          | Qty | State    | Source   |
| -------- | ------------- | --- | -------- | -------- |
| MS-001   | Ms Sheet      | 28  | Raw      | GRN-0001 |
| FG-001   | Mounted Plate | 490 | Finished | PRD-0001 |
| SCRP-001 | Ms Sheet      | 10  | Scrap    | PRD-0001 |

---

## 🎯 Benefits of This Flow

✅ Batch-wise traceability
✅ Scrap and yield analysis
✅ WIP tracking per production
✅ Auto updates to multi-state inventory
✅ Can track rework, QC, delay, and costing
✅ Enables accurate inventory valuation

---

## 📌 Optional Advanced Features (Future Scope)

* Add **QC Status** per finished batch
* Assign **operator/labor** for performance tracking
* **Auto BOM-based material suggestions**
* **Production Costing**: Labor + material = item rate
* **Process-wise production routing**
