To deeply understand the **integration of BOM, UOM, Inventory, GRN, and Job Work** in your Factory Management App, let's break it down module by module and show how they **interact** step-by-step:

---

## 🔄 **FULL MODULE INTEGRATION FLOW**

### 🧩 1. **UOM (Unit of Measure)**

UOM defines **how quantities are tracked**:

* **Purchase UOM** = what you buy (e.g., Kg or Sheet)
* **Inventory UOM** = what you store (e.g., Kg)
* **Production/Sale UOM** = what you sell or convert to (e.g., Pieces)

> **Key Use Case**:
> You buy 1 MS Sheet (as Kg), but it makes 400 mounted plates (pieces).
> UOM defines this mapping: `1 Sheet = 400 Mounted Plates`.

---

### 🧾 2. **BOM (Bill of Materials)**

Defines the **recipe for production**:

* Output: Mounted Plate
* Input: MS Sheet (UOM = Kg or Sheets)
* Quantity: 1 sheet = 400 pcs

> Example:
> BOM: To make 400 Mounted Plates
> 🔸 Required: 1 MS Sheet
> 🔸 Labor, overhead, margin = defined in BOM
> 🔸 Output UOM = pcs

---

### 📦 3. **Inventory**

Tracks **stock at every state**:

| State    | Description                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Raw      | Initial MS Sheets                         |
| WIP      | Sheets given for job work                 |
| Finished | Mounted plates or other finished products |
| Scrap    | Any loss or damaged output from processes |

→ Based on BOM and UOM, **automated inventory movement** happens:

* Job Work created → move Raw → WIP
* GRN received → move WIP → Finished + Scrap

---

### 🛠️ 4. **Job Work**

Handles **in-house or outsourced processing**:

| Input      | Process      | Output             |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| MS Sheet   | Cutting      | 400 Mounted Plates |
| Mounted    | Zinc Plating | Zinced Plates      |
| Zinc Plate | Bending      | Final Castor Body  |

> **Integration with BOM and UOM**:

* Job Work input = MS Sheet (UOM-aware)
* Output = Based on BOM conversion (e.g., 1 sheet → 400 pcs)
* Job Work form auto-picks UOM conversion & BOM to calculate expected output

---

### 📥 5. **GRN (Goods Receipt Note)**

When Job Work is completed, GRN is used to **receive** finished goods:

* Receive based on Job Work
* Track:

  * Output Quantity (finished goods)
  * Scrap Quantity
  * Quality Inspected / Passed / Rejected
* Automatically update:

  * WIP Stock: ↓
  * Finished Stock: ↑
  * Scrap: ↑

---

## 🔗 **How They All Link**

1. **Create BOM**

   * Define product → materials → output
   * UOM ensures correct quantity mapping

2. **Inventory**

   * MS Sheet enters inventory in Kg or Sheet
   * System uses UOM to track exact stock in pcs

3. **Create Job Work**

   * Pick process: e.g. Cutting
   * Input = MS Sheet
   * Output = Mounted Plate (based on BOM and UOM)
   * Inventory: Raw ↓ WIP ↑

4. **Create GRN**

   * After job work is done
   * Receive:

     * 400 pcs Finished
     * 10 pcs Scrap
   * Inventory: WIP ↓, Finished ↑, Scrap ↑

5. **Production / Next Step**

   * Same process can repeat for Zinc, Bending, Assembly etc.

## ✅ **BENEFITS OF THIS INTEGRATION**

| Feature       | Benefit                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **UOM**       | Tracks unit conversion automatically            |
| **BOM**       | Ensures correct material usage and costing      |
| **Inventory** | Shows real-time material stage                  |
| **Job Work**  | Tracks every outsourced/in-house process        |
| **GRN**       | Ensures material receipt, scrap, and inspection |
