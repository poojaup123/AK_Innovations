Cleaning up your Flask **Factory Management App** codebase is essential to avoid duplicates, improve maintainability, and reduce UI/logic conflicts â€” especially since you're scaling rapidly with modules like OCR, production, accounting, batch tracking, etc.

---

## âœ… Step-by-Step Guide to Clean Your Codebase

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Audit the Project Structure**

Go through the **project folders**:

* Identify **duplicate files** (like `create_admin.py`, `create_approval_sample.py`, `create_batch_sample.py`) â€“ move them into one CLI utility file or folder.
* Remove test/demo files that are no longer used.

âœ… **Goal**: Keep only these at root level:

```
run.py, .env, README.md, /app, /migrations
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Refactor Models**

If you have everything in a large `models.py` file:

âœ… Split it into:

* `models/core.py` â†’ User, Supplier, Item
* `models/accounting.py` â†’ Account, Voucher, Invoice
* `models/inventory.py` â†’ ItemBatch, UOM
* `models/jobwork.py`, `models/bom.py`, etc.

âœ… Use `__init__.py` to import them cleanly.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Group Services Logically**

Move logic from views (routes) to service files:

âœ… Create files like:

* `services/production_service.py`
* `services/accounting_automation.py`
* `services/batch_tracking.py`

These should contain all calculations, DB logic, and data flow â€” **keep routes clean and readable**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Optimize Templates and Layouts**

Check `templates/`:

âœ… Structure it like this:

```
templates/
â”œâ”€â”€ base.html
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory/
â”œâ”€â”€ accounting/
â”œâ”€â”€ jobwork/
â”œâ”€â”€ ocr/
```

ðŸ§¹ Delete unused templates, partials, or broken layouts.

ðŸ§  Tip: Use `includes/` for buttons, modals, and common components.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Remove Duplicate Routes**

Open `/routes/`:

âœ… Check for:

* Repeated route functions
* Pages using same logic but different names
* Misplaced or test routes

âœ… Keep 1 route per logical operation.

ðŸ§  If routes get too large, split them into modules like `routes/accounting_payments.py`, `routes/accounting_reports.py`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Refactor Frontend Assets**

Inside `/static/`:

âœ… Remove unused CSS/JS files.

âœ… Merge redundant styles into `custom.css`.

âœ… Minify JS/CSS files using:

```bash
npm install -g clean-css-cli
cleancss -o custom.min.css custom.css
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Consolidate CLI Scripts**

You currently have:

```
create_admin.py
create_batch_sample.py
create_approval_sample.py
...
```

âœ… Combine them into one CLI module:
`cli.py`

Example:

```python
@click.group()
def cli():
    pass

@cli.command()
def create_admin():
    ...

@cli.command()
def create_sample_batch():
    ...
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. **Use `.flake8` and `black` for Code Formatting**

Install:

```bash
pip install flake8 black
```

Format:

```bash
black app/ cli.py
flake8 app/
```

This cleans up indentation, spacing, and warns you of unused imports or bad practices.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 9. **Run Full Cleanup & Testing**

Before deployment:

* âœ… `python -m unittest discover`
* âœ… `python cli.py check-db-tables`
* âœ… Manual UI testing (to ensure layout is not broken)
* âœ… Remove `*.pyc`, `__pycache__/`, and junk files.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 10. **Create a Clean Git Commit**

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "ðŸ§¹ Cleanup: Removed duplicates, optimized structure and UI"
```

## âœ… Want Me to Auto-Generate the Refactored Structure?

I can output the **clean folder structure with boilerplate**, and migration guide step by step â€” just confirm:

* Do you want it in-place?
* Or as a new cloned directory like `/app_clean/`?

Let me know and Iâ€™ll help you cleanly migrate.
