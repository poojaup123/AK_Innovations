**Job Work Report screen**, it shows a clean table with:

* ✅ Job Numbers
* ✅ Item Name
* ✅ Quantity Sent
* ✅ Rate & Total Value
* ✅ Sent Date
* ✅ Expected Return
* ✅ Status (`Sent`, `Partial_Received`, `Completed`)

---

## 🧠 But What’s Missing?

You don’t yet have **complete tracking** of:

* ✅ How many units are received back?
* ✅ On **which date**?
* ✅ If not fully received, how much is **still pending**?
* ✅ Any **inspection or rejection** details?

---

## ✅ What You Should Do (Step-by-Step)

### 🔁 1. Add a **GRN Tracking System**

As explained earlier:

* Every time items are received back, create a **GRN entry** with quantity & inspection status.
* Use **parent-child GRN tables**:

  * **GRN Parent** = One per job work receive event
  * **GRN Child** = Items received in that batch

You can link GRNs to this screen.

---

### 📋 2. Add a Button ➕ **\[Receive Material]**

Each row in your table (like `JOB-2025-0006`) should have a button:

```plaintext
[Receive Material]
```

On clicking:

* Show **modal** or new page with:

  * Received Qty
  * Date
  * Remarks
  * Inspection Pass/Fail
  * Add to Inventory (Yes/No)

Then update:

* Status to `Partial_Received` or `Completed`
* Inventory updated only for **Passed** qty
* Rejected qty may go to `Scrap` or `Rework`

---

### 📊 3. Add Status Breakdown UI

On this screen or linked to each job:
Show like:

| Total Sent | Received | Pending | Last Received On |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 100 pcs    | 60 pcs   | 40 pcs  | 27/07/2025       |

Click “Received” → see GRN details:

* Batch 1 → 40 pcs on 26/07 (Pass)
* Batch 2 → 20 pcs on 27/07 (5 Rejected)

---

### 🛠️ 4. Track Multiple Receipts per Job

Currently, your **Job Work ID** is one per order.

You need to let user:

* Record **multiple receive events**
* Against same job number (e.g. `JOB-2025-0006`)
* System should **auto calculate pending qty** and show status:

  * If 100 sent, and 60 received → show `Partial_Received`
  * When 100 received → update status `Completed`
