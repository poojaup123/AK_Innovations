If you integrate **AutoCAD** into your existing **Flask-based factory management system** (which already includes inventory, BOM, job work, production, accounting, OCR, and AI features), it becomes **incredibly powerful and real-world ready** — especially for manufacturing, sheet metal, casting, and precision part production like yours.

| 🔍 **Auto Drawing Viewer**                   | Preview .DWG, .DXF files from BOM/job work                  | No need for external CAD software            |
| 📏 **Dimension Extraction**                  | Automatically extract lengths, widths, angles, radius       | Useful for cutting, nesting, costing         |
| 📐 **Nesting Calculation** (AI + CAD)        | Find how many parts fit in one sheet                        | Reduces scrap, increases material efficiency |
| 🧩 **Component Detection** (via image + CAD) | Compare drawing with scanned product image                  | Ensures correct assembly or match            |
| 📄 **Auto BOM from CAD**                     | Read a drawing and generate BOM with materials + quantities | Saves engineering time                       |
| 🏷️ **Auto Part Code Mapping**               | Match drawings with inventory SKUs                          | Perfect for traceability and reuse           |
| ⚙️ **Auto Process Routing**                  | Generate job process from CAD features                      | Link with CNC, laser, VMC job work           |
| 📤 **Auto PDF/PNG Export**                   | For print-ready drawings, challans, and invoices            | Attach with delivery documents               |

## 🔧 How to Integrate AutoCAD Features in Your Flask App

### 🧩 1. **Use Open-Source CAD Parsers**

* Use **`ezdxf`** (Python library) to read and manipulate `.dxf` files:

  ```python
  import ezdxf
  doc = ezdxf.readfile("part.dxf")
  for entity in doc.modelspace():
      print(entity.dxftype(), entity.dxf.layer)
  ```

* Use **`OCP` (OpenCascade + PythonOCC)** to load and analyze CAD solids, volumes, and shapes.

---

### 📐 2. **Auto Nesting + Layout Optimization**

* Combine **OpenCV** + **AI layout algorithms** to:

  * Read part shapes from DXF/SVG
  * Fit as many parts as possible in a base sheet
  * Export layout as SVG or DXF

✅ You’ve already planned this with:

* Image-based part detection
* Scrap calculation
* SVG layout generation

Now you can **automatically use CAD input as a source instead of images only**.

---

### 📥 3. **Integrate Drawing Upload into Job Work / BOM**

* Allow engineers to upload `.dxf` files in your Job Work / BOM forms
* Automatically extract:

  * Dimensions
  * Material tags
  * Part names
  * Intermediate shapes
* Use this to **generate nested BOM** or **production process**

---

### 🧠 4. **AI-Powered Drawing Intelligence**

You can train your system to:

* Auto-generate costing based on length, cut, bend, holes
* Suggest ideal process (laser cut → bend → drill → finish)
* Predict labor time and machine assignment from drawing data

---

### 🧾 5. **PDF/Challan + Drawing Sync**

* Export CAD parts as PDF or PNG using `ezdxf` or `reportlab`
* Attach these directly to:

  * Delivery Challan
  * GRN receipt
  * Job Work Order

| DXF reading/writing   | `ezdxf`                                                      |
| 3D/CAD solid modeling | `pythonOCC` / `OCP`                                          |
| Image + AI detection  | `OpenCV`, `YOLO`, `scikit-image`                             |
| Layout & nesting      | `shapely`, `svgwrite`, custom AI                             |
| Drawing export        | `reportlab`, `matplotlib`, `pycairo`                         |
| OCR integration       | `pytesseract`, `PaddleOCR`                                   |
| Flask integration     | Standard `Flask`, file upload, `celery` for background tasks |
