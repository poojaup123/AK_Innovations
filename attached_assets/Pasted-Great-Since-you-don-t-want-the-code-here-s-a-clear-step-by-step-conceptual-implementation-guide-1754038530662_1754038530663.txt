Great! Since you donâ€™t want the code, hereâ€™s a **clear, step-by-step conceptual implementation guide** of how to **implement batch-wise tracking** in your factory management app â€” without any coding, just architecture and logic.

## âœ… Step-by-Step: Batch-wise Tracking in Your App (Non-Code)

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 1: Enable Batch in GRN (Goods Receipt Note)**

**What to do:**

* When raw material is received, assign a **unique Batch Code** (manual or auto).
* Capture:

  * Batch code
  * Quantity
  * UOM (e.g. kg, pcs)
  * MFG date (optional)
  * Expiry date (optional)
  * Initial State = **Raw**

**Result:**
You now have identifiable stock stored **per batch**, not just per item.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 2: Store Inventory by Batch**

**What to do:**

* Your inventory table should now show:

  * Item
  * Batch Code
  * Quantity Available
  * State: Raw / WIP / Finished / Scrap
  * UOM
  * Source (e.g., GRN, Production, Return)

**Result:**
Each item can have multiple lines (batches), all with different quantities or states.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 3: Issue Material for Job Work (Batch Selection)**

**What to do:**

* When issuing raw material for job work:

  * Select the **batch code** of the material
  * Enter quantity to issue
  * System should move this quantity from **Raw** to **WIP**
  * Store Job Work ID + Vendor + Date + Batch Info

**Result:**
The system knows **exactly which batch was sent out** and how much is still left.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 4: Return from Job Work (Batch-Aware)**

**What to do:**
When vendor returns job work output:

* Input:

  * Output product name
  * New **Output Batch Code**
  * Quantity produced
  * Scrap Quantity (if any)
  * Returned unused quantity of raw material
  * Link to original **input batch**

**Result:**

* You generate a new batch for output (Finished)
* Update raw batch with returned unused quantity
* Log scrap separately (Scrap batch or tag)

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 5: Inventory Auto-Updating Based on States**

**System should do:**

* Deduct issued quantity from original batch (MS-001)
* Move issued quantity to WIP when sent out
* On return:

  * Add to Finished Goods as new batch (e.g. FG-001)
  * Add scrap to Scrap state
  * Add unused material back to the raw batch

**Result:**
Your inventory remains 100% accurate and **state-aware**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 6: Inventory View**

**Your inventory screen should show:**

\| Item         | Batch Code | Qty | UOM | State     | Source        | |
\|--------------|------------|-----|-----|-----------|----------------|
\| MS Sheet     | MS-001     | 17  | Sheet | Raw     | GRN-456       |
\| MS Sheet     | MS-001     | 0   | Sheet | WIP     | JW-1001       |
\| Mounted Plate| FG-001     | 500 | Pcs  | Finished| JW-1001       |
\| Scrap Plate  | SCRAP-JW1001| 20 | Pcs | Scrap   | JW-1001       |

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 7: Batch Movement History **

You can maintain a batch ledger:

* GRN â†’ Raw â†’ WIP â†’ Finished â†’ Dispatched
* Input batch linked to output batch
* Helps with:

  * ISO audits
  * Vendor QC
  * Recall investigation

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 8: Reports You Can Now Generate**

| Report                       | Description                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Batch Consumption Report     | Which batch was used where                 |
| Job Work Yield Report        | How much output from input, scrap etc.     |
| Scrap Report                 | Batch-wise scrap generated                 |
| Batch Ageing Report          | How old each batch is                      |
| Vendor Performance           | Track scrap %, efficiency from each vendor |
| Inventory Valuation by Batch | Batch-wise cost/qty tracking               |

## ðŸ”„ Use Cases Enabled by Batch-wise Tracking

| Situation                                     | How Batch Tracking Helps                |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| You get a customer complaint on product batch | Trace which raw batch was used          |
| A raw batch has quality issues                | Stop using it in job work or production |
| You want to dispatch only oldest material     | Use FIFO logic with batch date          |
| Audit requires full material movement history | Easily generate traceability reports    |
| You want to prevent duplicate or over-issue   | Batch control restricts overspending    |

## ðŸ“Œ Summary: System-Wide Impact

| Module     | Batch Integration Role                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| GRN        | Creates new batches                            |
| Inventory  | Tracks quantity, state, and origin per batch   |
| Job Work   | Sends and returns materials batch-wise         |
| Production | Converts input batches into new output batches |
| Scrap      | Separates defective quantities batch-wise      |
| Reports    | Enables full traceability and audit readiness  |

---

## âœ… You Now Have:

* Traceability from raw material to finished product
* Control over every gram/sheet/piece by batch
* Vendor accountability
* Cleaner inventory system
* Audit + complaint-ready infrastructure
