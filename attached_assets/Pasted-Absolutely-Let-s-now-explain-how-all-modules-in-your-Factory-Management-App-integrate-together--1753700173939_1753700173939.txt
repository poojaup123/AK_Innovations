Absolutely! Letâ€™s now explain **how all modules in your Factory Management App integrate together** â€” from **Inventory â†’ BOM â†’ UOM â†’ Job Work â†’ GRN â†’ Production â†’ Sales** â€” so that the system works automatically and smartly.

---

## âœ… MASTER CONCEPT: "Single Source Inventory Flow"

Everything â€” **purchase, job work, production, GRN, sales** â€” is linked to your **master inventory table**, and transitions between states are automated.

## ðŸ§± 1. **Inventory Master Table**

Your core table for tracking:

| Field         | Description                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| item\_code    | Unique item identifier             |
| name          | Item name                          |
| qty\_raw      | Raw material qty                   |
| qty\_wip      | Sent for job work or production    |
| qty\_finished | Finished goods ready for sale      |
| qty\_scrap    | Scrap/damaged qty                  |
| uom\_id       | Linked UOM (e.g., KG, PCS, Sheets) |

âœ… All modules read/write from this table.

---

## ðŸ§± 2. **UOM (Unit of Measure) Integration**

UOM Conversion Table:

| from\_uom | to\_uom | factor |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| KG        | PCS     | 8.33   |
| Sheet     | PCS     | 400    |

Used to convert during:

* PO Receipt â†’ Convert KG â†’ PCS
* Job Work â†’ Convert Sheets â†’ Output PCS
* Production â†’ Verify available inventory in required UOM

âœ… You can even support **multi-UOM** (buy in KG, produce in PCS, sell in Box).

---

## ðŸ§± 3. **BOM (Bill of Materials)**

| bom\_id | product\_id | component\_id | qty\_required | uom\_id |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| 1       | Caster      | Mounted Plate | 2 PCS         | PCS     |
| 1       | Caster      | Base Plate    | 1 PCS         | PCS     |

BOM is used by:

* **Production**: To know whatâ€™s needed to make a product
* **Job Work**: To validate expected outputs
* **GRN**: To confirm if output matches expected BOM

âœ… BOM + UOM ensures correct material planning.

---

## ðŸ§± 4. **Job Work**

| Field            | Description                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| input\_item      | e.g., MS Sheet             |
| input\_qty       | e.g., 10 Sheets            |
| output\_item     | e.g., Mounted Plate        |
| expected\_output | e.g., 4000 PCS             |
| process\_type    | Single / Multi             |
| job\_type        | In-house / Outsourced      |
| linked\_bom\_id  | Matches against BOM        |
| status           | sent / partial / completed |

âœ… Job Work consumes `qty_raw`, updates `qty_wip`

---

## ðŸ§± 5. **GRN (Goods Receipt Note)**

One form to receive everything:

| Field          | Description                |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| source\_type   | PO / Job Work / Production |
| reference\_id  | Job ID / PO ID             |
| process\_step  | Cutting, Zinc (multi-step) |
| received\_qty  | How many received          |
| scrap\_qty     | How many scrap             |
| final\_item    | What item came back        |
| date\_received | Receipt date               |

âœ… On receipt:

* Reduces `qty_wip`
* Increases `qty_finished` or next process `qty_wip`
* Adds to `qty_scrap` if needed

---

## ðŸ§± 6. **Production**

| Field                | Description                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| product\_to\_produce | e.g., Castor Wheel                |
| qty\_required        | e.g., 100 PCS                     |
| bom\_id              | What materials required           |
| status               | pending â†’ in\_process â†’ completed |

âœ… Production uses:

* `qty_raw` from Inventory (via BOM)
* Pushes WIP â†’ Finished
* Optionally can record `damaged`, `scrap`

---

## ðŸ§± 7. **Sales**

Uses `qty_finished` to dispatch:

| Field        | Description       |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| item\_id     | e.g., Zinc Caster |
| qty\_sold    | 50 PCS            |
| invoice\_no  | AUTO              |
| customer\_id | Linked customer   |
| date         | Dispatch date     |

âœ… Deducts from `qty_finished`

---

## ðŸ§  INTELLIGENT WORKFLOW (EXAMPLE)

1. You purchase 10 MS Sheets (UOM: Sheet)
2. UOM conversion: 10 Sheets = 4000 Mounted Plates
3. Job Work Created:

   * Cutting Process
   * In-house or Vendor
4. GRN Created:

   * Received 3950 good
   * 50 scrap
5. Inventory auto-updates:

   * WIP down
   * Finished up
   * Scrap recorded
6. Production consumes Mounted + Base Plates (via BOM)
7. Final Finished Good is ready
8. Sales Order ships it out

---

## ðŸ“Œ Reporting & Dashboard Integration

* Inventory Dashboard:

  * Stock by state
  * WIP status by job
* Production Efficiency:

  * Input vs output vs scrap
* UOM Traceability:

  * Conversion accuracy
* GRN/Job Work Timeline:

  * Who did what, when, and how much
