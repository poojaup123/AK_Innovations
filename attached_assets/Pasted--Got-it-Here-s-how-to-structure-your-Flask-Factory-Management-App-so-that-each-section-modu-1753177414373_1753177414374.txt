âœ… Got it! Here's how to structure your **Flask Factory Management App** so that **each section (module)** has its **own dashboard** â€” simple, modular, and admin-controlled.

### âœ… Each Section Should Have Its Own Dashboard

#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal:

Give each key module a **clean dashboard** with summary widgets, quick actions, and recent activity. Keep it **basic and professional UI** (Bootstrap 5).

### ðŸ§© Sections & Their Dashboards

### ðŸ§± Folder Structure Suggestion

```
factory_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ inventory/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dashboard.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ purchase/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dashboard.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ static/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ css, js
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ inventory_routes.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ purchase_routes.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### âœ… UI Layout (Basic)

```html
<!-- Example: templates/inventory/dashboard.html -->
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
<h2>Inventory Dashboard</h2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="card p-3">
      <h5>Total Items</h5>
      <p>{{ total_items }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="card p-3 bg-warning">
      <h5>Low Stock</h5>
      <p>{{ low_stock }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

### âœ… Next Steps

1. Do you want me to:

   * Generate `inventory_dashboard` route and template?
   * Repeat for each section?
2. Want this to be accessible only by roles like `admin` or `manager`?

Let me know and Iâ€™ll generate code for the first dashboard as your starting point.
